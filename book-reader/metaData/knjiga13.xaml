Aden was reached at last--“The coal hole of the East.” As a
health resort, I cannot conscientiously recommend it. The heat was
overwhelming, and the local Hotel Ritz sadly wanting in some things and
overdone in others. We found it necessary to spend some days there and
many sleepless nights, pursuing during the latter the big game in our
bedrooms. “Keatings” was of no use. I believe the local insects were
case-hardened veterans, and rather liked the powder than otherwise. What
nights we had! But every one was </Run><Run Background="#FFFF0000">in like case, for from all over the
house came the sound of slippers banging and much scuffling, and from
the room opposite to mine language consigning all insects, the Aden</Run><Run>
variety in particular, to some even warmer place.

In some ways the hotel was more than up to date. Nothing so ordinary
as a mere common or garden bell in one’s room. Instead, a sort of dial,
like the face of a clock, with every conceivable want written round it,
from a great desire to meet the manager to a wish to call out the
local Fire Brigade. You turned on a small steel finger to point at your
particular requirement, rang a bell--_et voilà!_ It seems mere carping
to state that the matter ended with _voilà_. The dials were there, you
might ring if you liked--what more do you want? Some day some one will
answer. Meanwhile, one can always shout.

We met two other shooting parties at our _auberge_. The first comprised
a man and his elderly wife who were not immediately starting, some of
their kit having gone astray. He was a noted shot, and Madam had been
some minor trip with him and meant to accompany another. She was an
intensely cross-grained person, quite the last woman I should yearn to
be cooped up in a tent with for long at a time. Cecily’s idea of it was
that the shikari husband meant, sooner or later, to put into practice
the words of that beautiful song, “Why don’t you take her out and lose
her?” and stuck to it that we should one day come on head-lines in the
_Somaliland Daily Wail_ reading something like this:=

````GREAT SHIKARI IN TEARS.
